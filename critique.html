    <h1>Design Critique of Every Noise at Once</h1>
    <p><a href = "https://everynoise.com/engenremap.html">Every Noise at Once</a></p>

    <h2>Purpose and Overview</h2>
    <p>The site is scatter plot of different music genres, with the purpose being to showcase different genres
        and make it easier for users to find new artists and genres. It includes ways to search for artists, search for genres and
        listen to samples of music. The X-axis moves from atmospheric to bouncier music while the Y-axis moves from organic to synthetic
        music. The colors are based off 3 rbg values, red is determined based on the energy level on a genre, green on the dynamic variation
        and blue on how instramental the the genre is.
    </p>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>The data used with the site is from Spotify. This includes the genres and the artists associated with them. The music used
        as examples is also pulled Spotify. Since the site is owned by Spotify, it is able to easily aquire the data and stay up 
        to date on artists and genres.
    </p>
    <h2>Users</h2>
    <p>The main users for this site are also Spotify users, however anyone with an interest in music can use the site. Since it 
        helpfully groups artists by genres, it is easy for music fans to find similar artists to ones they're already familar with.
    </p>
    <h2>Discoveries</h2>
    <p>
        The discoveries for this site are all related to music. For example, someone might want to know what music is similar to
        their favorite genre or information about their favorite artists. To find answers to questions like these, they can scroll
        through the scatterplot or just search for artists and genres.
        For example, one of my favorite artists right now is Versengold. If I were to search for them, I'd get a popup saying they're 
        classifed as medieval rock. 
    </p>    
    <p><img src="../search.JPG" alt="Search bar showing Versengold" style="width:50%"></p>
    <p>
        From here, I can get more information, clicking the i symbol leads to page with information on Versengold. 
    </p>
    <p><img src="../verinfo.JPG" alt="Page showing information on Versengold" style="width:50%;"></p>
    <p>
        Or I can click on the hamburger menu to get a list of similar genres and a medieval rock playlist.
    </p>

    <h2>Effective Design Choices</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plays samples of music, making it easy to quickly determine if users like a genre or artist.</li>
            <li>Linked with the dataset it pulls from and updates with it. As Spotify adds new music and genres so does Every Noise at Once.</li>
            <li>Links out to many playlists, making it much easier for users to find new music.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Ineffective Design Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A legend needs to be added to help explain the x and y axis as well as colors</li>
            <li>Relies heavily on Spotify's genres. This makes sense as it's linked with Spotify, but is confusing as Spotify tends to make up a lot of new genres.</li>
            <li>Has problems with spacing when it comes to foreign characters.</li>
            <p><img src="../spacing.JPG" alt="Scatterplot showing overlapping Japanese characters" style="width:15%"></p>
            <li>Doesn't allow for selecting multiple genres, for example if I wanted to see how close artists from medieval rock are with neue deutsche harte I can't.</li>
            <li>Allows to search for countries but only through genre names like "thai metal" and "finnish pop". I should be able to just look for songs from Finland and filter from there.</li>

        </ul>
